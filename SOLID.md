#SOLID principles

## Explain the SOLID principles in PHP.

SOLID stands for five design principles that improve software maintainability:

S - Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.

O - Open/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be replaceable with their parent class.

I - Interface Segregation Principle: Avoid forcing classes to implement unused methods.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
