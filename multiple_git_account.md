> is this possible to push shamimdewan and shamimdewan390 2 separate account ,  i want to controll 2 account same time.. is this possible?


Yes, absolutely possible! Here's how to manage 2 GitHub accounts on the same machine:
The Best Way — SSH Config (Recommended)
Step 1: Generate 2 SSH keys


```bash
# For account 1
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "shamimdewan@email.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_shamimdewan

# For account 2
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "shamimdewan390@email.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_shamimdewan390
```

by default key generated by named ```id_ed25519``` and ```id_end25519.pub```
